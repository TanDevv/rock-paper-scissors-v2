# rock-paper-scissors-v2
Rock Paper Scissors by Odin Project, only remade.

A remade version of my original RPS project by Odin Project.

I wanted to start over and completely develop this project including HTML/CSS/JS altogether. I wanted to also try adding in a library like the confetti effect.

There are some additions I would like to still add to this project:

~~• Highlight player/computer scores in bold using spans in JS~~ (DONE)
• Add dynamic SVGs that change when a user clicks a button via JS
